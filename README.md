# Skydrop | Chicken Game

# Introduction

Game is simple, how many eggs can the chicken catch under 1 minute. Avoid catching the rotten eggs otherwise
points are deducted. I will set a threshold, if the player catches 3 rotten eggs under 1 minute means 'you lose'.

### Iteration 1: Draw the game board

I have already found a chicken coop background image, from source https://doodlelor.itch.io/chickengameassets

### Iteration 2: Draw the chicken, fresh egg and rotten egg.

- Add the chicken, fresh egg, and rotten egg images on top of the background image.

### Iteration 3: Make the chicken go left & right and will find a way to make the chicken jump

- The chicken will go left, right and jump to catch the fresh eggs faster.

### Iteration 4: Make the fresh eggs drop from the sky.

- The fresh eggs will drop from the sky at random.

### Iteration 5: Make the rotten eggs drop from the sky.

- The rotten eggs will drop from the sky at random but with a wider time interval.

### Iteration 6: Scoring system

- 1 fresh egg = 1 point.

### Iteration 7: Game Over!!!

- If the player catches 3 rotten eggs under 1 minute means its 'game over'.
